## Project Overview

This project taught me a great deal. It started as an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project and evolved into a full-stack Next.js project. Screenshots of each iteration are below.

## Phase One: Initial Setup

Initially, it was a simple static one-page site. A friend assisted in setting up a backend Express server to interact with the API.

## Phase Two: Moving to a better design and domain

The first working version of the site was built using only HTML and CSS with a Node.js Express server. We got our affiliate form approved by namecheap.com, earning 20% per order.

## Phase Three: Design and Domain Finalization

The second iteration brought design modifications and finalized the domain "naminggenie.com," which was generated by our app.

## Phase Four: Extensive Development to multipage website

The third iteration brought significant design and code modifications, though it was still not running on any framework. During this phase, I learned a lot about backend Express development as I built a complete blogging system. We realized that the most effective organic way to drive traffic was through SEO. Below, you'll see the blog template I developed.

## Phase Five: Nextjs/React Integration and SEO

My co-founder was in charge of SEO while he learned all about SEO and started writing blogs. I learned React, TailwindCSS, Next.js, Prisma, Zustand, and more, and created the fourth iteration of the website.

This is the version which is up and running currently, this uses Next.js and has about 50 pages of blogs written for SEO. You can check it out here [naminggenie.com](https://www.naminggenie.com/)

## SEO Impact

While the impression increased after adding the new version with the blogs, our average position went down significantly.
